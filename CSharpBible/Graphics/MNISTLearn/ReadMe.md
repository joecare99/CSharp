# Mnist-Dataset Learning

This project demonstrates how to build and train a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is widely used for training and testing image processing systems.

## Prerequisites
- Download the MNIST dataset from https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist. (the original source was http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) but not available anymore.
- Ensure you have .NET 10.0 SDK or later installed on your machine.

Have fun learning.
