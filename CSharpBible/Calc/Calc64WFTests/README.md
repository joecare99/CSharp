# Calc64WFTests

(Alternative / duplicated test folder structure – see also README in the main `Calc64WFTests` folder if multiple variants exist.)

Contains tests for the WinForms 64?bit calculator UI (see separate README in parent test folder if present). If this folder contains a variant for modern targets (`_netTests`) the goals are identical: ensure correctness of view model and converter behavior.
